# Tor::Playground

A personal and quasi-professional playground for playing with the semantic web.

## Experiment 1

Goal: Develop a better understanding of Sparql queries.

My plan is to start with a semantic data-set of which I'm familiar: [My personal blog](https://takeonrules.com).

- [ ] Extract RDF graph of one page
- [ ] Wrap extracted RDF graph in Sparql complient end-point
- [ ] Write Sparql query against end-point
